As of 2024 I’ve been programming computers for about 25 years. I started writing Perl, picked up C (as was the “paved road” at the time) before moving into many other languages like Scala and Rust. I have a BSc in Computing Science too.

After that long coding alone loses its novelty - I feel it’s making things that drives engineers. I’ve been leading engineering teams for over five years now and like I did with programming, I’m starting to see repeating patterns. That brings me to why I’m here. I have three goals:

1. **To improve my ability to express complex ideas through writing**
2. **Ensuring my thoughts are oriented and scrutable (as opposed to a jumbled set of observations)**
3. **Providing a place to link back to my thoughts on a specific subject in discussions**

I want to provide some value to you through me trying to reach those goals, and I feel like if I miss I’ll probably still learn something. I’ll know I’ve succeeded if I’m embarrassed and/or unimpressed looking back. 

Memento mori (the original YOLO),
