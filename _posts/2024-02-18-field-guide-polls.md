![A poll on tabs v spaces with inconclusive results](/assets/img/posts/bad-poll.jpg)

Polls like this - completely inconclusive - seem to fill slack channels everywhere. I intend to describe some reasons why this happens and a recipe to get decisions over the line. It’s aimed primarily at those readers charged with a team or the responsibility for a decision. 

*[If you don't want or need the background information, click here for the conclusion.](#putting-it-all-together-a-recipe-for-decision-making-with-group-input-the-vote-discuss-decide-play)*

## Types of poll

Many tools provide one "default" poll configuration but it seems usually optimized for the poll providers' engagement statistics rather than the effectiveness of your process. Here are some of the different poll parameters and the effects I have observed using them. 

### Forced choice polls

These are polls where everyone must cast a vote. I’d discourage their use for decision making purposes.

However inviting it is to compel fence sitters to pick, it generally makes people very uncomfortable and people unsure of their decisions tend not to execute on them very well. This is enough of a reason to limit their use. There are uses for forced polls outside decision making, such as aligning a group by compelling them to look at the same issues however. 

Many people make the assumption that fence sitters don’t care or are otherwise disengaged. In my experience this is quite rare. There’s usually another reason like assuming they are not qualified or revealing their views might be embarrassing. This meta-information however is valuable in itself - it indicates how strongly a group feels about an issue, or how safe everyone feels to contribute. If you force people to enter a vote you risk losing such information.  

### Named vs Anonymous polls

Anonymous polls are those where you can’t see who voted - only the number of votes. Named polls are those in which we can see who voted for what (or those that didn’t vote). Unlike most of the different poll types there isn’t an obvious choice here.

Deciding which is appropriate seems to depend on the overall psychological safety level of the group. If the group is large or new to each other, or hasn’t worked out productive ways to broach conflict, pick anonymous votes. If the group is close knit and open, save yourself some time and pick named polls. 

I often see people struggling to navigate discussions on anonymous poll results with the tendency to want to de-anonymize voters. This is unwise as the reason for anonymous polls is to encourage psychological safety, trying to de-anonymize results will elicit the opposite response.

Here are some questions you can ask after anonymous polls that still get the job done:

If some small percentage of people picked an option;

> It seems a couple picked X, what made them think differently?

> Not everyone agrees, what could we be missing?

If it's relatively even:

> For those that picked X, what do you think made people pick Y?
> For those that picked Y, what made it seem better than X?

### Open vs Closed polls

An open poll is one in which participants can see the results unfold as they go. These polls tend to lead to very high engagement for polling apps because it turns the vote into a watchable drama - you see how your team is playing throughout the game. Unless the drama is the purpose I would avoid open polls.

This drama damages the poll itself because people see the opportunity to risk nothing if their “team” is winning. They’ll tend to sit and watch, only voting when they see their preferred option is likely to lose. Likewise in named polls people may deliberately support the losing option to show support for the person behind the option; to save them a potentially embarrassing landslide. This all tends to lead to 50/50 splits (or close to) on every topic.
Binding vs non binding votes
Binding votes are where some criteria for a decision is being made in advance. Non binding polls/votes are taken as informative; they are explicitly being used for information gathering. I’d generally advise against binding votes because the results are rarely conclusive and despite being used as a tool by someone to distance themselves from a decision (“the David Cameron”) normally people see through it. 

The result perturbation in binding polls occurs because knowing the conditions in advance - like a 51% requirement or a supermajority - changes the nature of votes. The vote that pushes something over the threshold for example is worth considerably more than the first vote cast because you know how close you are to the threshold. so there’s a real incentive to delay your vote especially if it is an open poll/ballot.

Although not exclusively a property of binding polls, the binding nature also prevents leaders from declaring the poll invalid for a justified reason. For example if someone on holiday had some crucial information that would have changed the outcome. The saddest outcome for a poll or vote is one where important information is revealed by the poll results itself, such as a protest vote going too far. When we have votes like this, usually nobody is happy with the outcome and the action tends to get sandbagged.

## Important polling principles

There's more going on here than just configuring a poll. Here are some of the meta-poll topics I've found important.

### Decisions are made by the people responsible for the outcome

Even in a binding vote/poll, someone sets it as binding with their authority (and so takes responsibility for the outcome). 

Those new to responsibility tend to shirk this aspect of a vote. Oftentimes new managers for example will want to run a team entirely democratically, having periodic referenda on course changing topics. It’s a noble goal but there are a couple of almost insurmountable problems:

#### Your team doesn’t want the responsibility

People love being asked, but if you’re charged with a team you’re paid for the responsibility and the people in your team aren’t.

People want to be listened to and understood, sure, but this does not mean they want to be deferred to on every topic (even if they say they do). What’s more, continually polling all decisions can create a paralysis when a unilateral decision is necessary; this opens the door to relentless discontent and a tyranny of complainers. You risk getting nothing done on this path!

This isn’t an excuse to be a tyrant. If you could do it yourself, you don't need a team. It’s about creating a healthy homeostatic balance here where the team can influence decisions and understand when they are made that you’re acting in the best interest of the group. It’s in their interest from there on to commit - to avoid sandbagging or continually contesting the call.

#### Your team doesn’t know all the ramifications of what they’re picking

If you’re charged with a team, someone expects you to look after them. The organization or social group is expecting you to collect the information and be accountable for the result. This is how you will be evaluated, not the rest of the team. This is likely one of many things that you know that your team does not, or at least doesn’t really think about. Other things include what your peers are doing, the team’s reputation and what your boss is trying to get done. This kind of asymmetry is rarely acknowledged in democratic style systems, but it’s why nearly every country has a representative democracy rather than a direct one. We pay people to collect information and make decisions on our behalf because it would be exhausting for each of us to maintain the same level of context on a topic. 

Acknowledging asymmetry in information means that you know things your team does not, but it also likely means they know things you don’t. That’s why you’re asking them for a vote, right? 

#### There are practical problems achieving consensus 

Say you can solve the issues above through willpower or charisma, there are more intrinsic problems with votes. 

The Condorcet paradox is a great example. If the majority of people prefer Donald Trump over Hilary Clinton, but Hilary Clinton over Bernie Sanders, it’s entirely possible then that the majority of people might still prefer Bernie Sanders over Donald Trump. This is one of many unpickable messes, which in a high stakes game like the US presidency you might accept occasionally because the alternatives are typically some form of dictatorship. 

A lot of really smart people have spent time trying to limit the effects of this kind of paradox. However if you’re already a (benevolent) dictator it’s best to just not have these problems because they tend to create inactivity.  

### Make it easy for people to change their mind based on what other people think

Most people create votes to ensure people converge on a position rather than as a tool to generate divergence, but likely this is the exact opposite of what you want.  

The results of a poll change how people think about the topic as often it’s their first chance to see other people’s positions on a topic. If you feel strongly about tabs but you realise you’re the only one on the team, you will likely change how strongly you feel about it. 

What’s more, many votes are on non-binary topics where the best option is actually a secret third option - the best parts of both ways of thinking. This is only achievable with a discussion with the poll votes available (and the ability to ignore the results if it seems right to do). 

## Putting it all together; a recipe for decision making with group input: the vote, discuss, decide play

This is heavily influenced by David Marquet and his outstanding book leadership is language. I recommend reading it completely, but below is my take on his recipe for getting decisions made.

### 0x01 Preamble

House rules. Explain the process and who will make the decision (and when). It doesn’t have to be you, but it does need to be a named person willing to be responsible for the outcome. 

### 0x01 Vote

Create a poll in your tool of choice. Here's what you should set:

```
Type: 
Non binding. You decide based on the outcome (likely you're not going against the poll outcome however)
Closed. No watch along drama here. 

Optional:
Anonymous. Decide based on psychological safety level of the group (if it's low - provide anonymity)
```

### 0x02 Discuss

In the event of a landslide with >90% of people picking one option, quickly ask any dissenters or abstainees if they think we’ve missed anything (or if anonymous, ask the group what the dissenters/abstainees might be thinking differently). 

In the event of an even split, ask a representative from each group why they voted the way they did. Follow the room here, do people naturally want to change their votes after a discussion? Can the different opinions be joined? What do people think should be changed in the option they didn’t pick? Any really strong opinions? Why? 

### 0x03 Decide 

![Han saying make decisions and move on in fast and furious](/assets/img/posts/han.jpg)

Very likely the previous discussion will have ended in a concrete recommendation, but if it doesn’t, make a call and move on. Likely you will never have more information than this. Explain why you think what you do, and if it’s something that can be reversed, when you will next consider a review.
